# My Personal challenges for the next 2 years. 

Today i have started with my personal blog. I hope i will find the time to write about the things i like to speak about. 
In this case, the most topics will be about my personal journey to become a Cyber-Security Professional or Pentester.

I will work on different platforms to get closer to my goal. 

These platforms will be:
